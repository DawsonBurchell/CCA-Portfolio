            <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,<br>
I am applying for the Continuing Care Assistant position at your nursing home. I am currently completing the CCA program at NSCC and recently completed my clinical placement at Mountain Lea Lodge from November 10th to 28th, where I gained hands-on experience in personal care, ADLs, transfers, vital signs, and supporting residents with dignity and compassion.<br>
I thoroughly enjoyed building rapport with residents, learning from experienced CCAs, and contributing to a supportive, resident-focused care team. This placement prepared me well for the daily responsibilities and emotional rewards of working in long-term care.<br>
My background in leadership and team-based workplaces has given me strong communication, reliability, and problem-solving skills. I work well under pressure, adapt quickly, and always strive to create a positive, supportive environment for residents and staff. I approach every task with patience, empathy, and a strong commitment to resident-centered care.<br>
I would welcome the opportunity to bring my training, motivation, and strong work ethic to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you.<br>
Sincerely,<br>Dawson Z. Burchell</p>
